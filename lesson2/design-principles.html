            <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>

            <p>
                Apple's website is clean and filled with plenty of whitespace. They take pride in the design of their products and are always bragging that their products look beautiful because of "what they left out of the design". A simple, clean website with lots of whitespace conveys that message. The whitespace allows the products designs to "pop".

            <h2>PARC: Repetition</h2>

            <p>Amazon's Children's Books page features repeating images of little children and age group categories. Repetiton is important when shopping because often you have to drill down as you're seaching for a product. Repeating the navigation controls to the user allows them to think less about how to get to a product. </p>

            <h2>PARC: Proximity</h2>

            <p>PeacockTV's sign up form elements are neatly aligned and pleasing to the eye. This helps the user navigate the form and understand what they are doing. It is a text heavy page and everything is naturally aligned to the left. </p>
